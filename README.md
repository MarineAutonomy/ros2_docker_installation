# ROS2 Docker installation

## 1. Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu

Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

Use the following command to set up the repository:
```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Update the apt package index:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:
```
sudo docker run hello-world
```

## 2. Manage Docker as a non-root user

Create the docker group.
```
sudo groupadd docker
```

Add your user to the docker group.
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Activate the changes to groups
```
newgrp docker
```

Verify that you can run `docker` commands without `sudo`
```
docker run hello-world
```

## 3. Install the ROS2 Docker Image

Create a folder which will contain all the required files
```
mkdir ROS2
cd ROS2
```

Clone the `ros2_docker_installation` repository
```
git clone https://github.com/MarineAutonomy/ros2_docker_installation.git
```
```
cd ros2_docker_installation
```

Build the Docker Image from the Dockerfile
```
./docker.sh
```

Run the docker image and start a conatiner
```
./run_docker.sh
```

You should now see `docker@` at the start of command-lines
```
colcon build
```

This creates the `build` `install` and `log` inside the `colcon_ws` folder.

You can `exit` the container to see the file system

```
exit
```

## 4. SBG sensor demo

Restart the container
```
./run_docker.sh
```

Though the sensor is not connected to your device you can stil see the data being published as the device is connected to tutorial host's device
ROS2 allows devices with same `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` and connected by same network to communicate with each other easily.
